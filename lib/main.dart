// Flutter code sample for material.Scaffold.1

// This example shows a [Scaffold] with an [AppBar], a [BottomAppBar] and a
// [FloatingActionButton]. The [body] is a [Text] placed in a [Center] in order
// to center the text within the [Scaffold] and the [FloatingActionButton] is
// centered and docked within the [BottomAppBar] using
// [FloatingActionButtonLocation.centerDocked]. The [FloatingActionButton] is
// connected to a callback that increments a counter.

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// The 'main' function is the starting point for all our Flutter apps.
void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Center(
        child: Text('Hello World'),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
